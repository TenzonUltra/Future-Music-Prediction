# Music Time Series Analysis

## About
Time Series Analysis of Music Data to find various information about the changes in music characteristics over the last 100 years as well as usevarious models ( ARIMA, LSTM etc.) to predict the popular characteristics in the Future.

## Data
The DataSet for this project was obtained from Kaggle, which itself was derived and cleaned a bit from the Spotify API itself. The Data was then further cleaned for our models in the Prep and EDA Notebook, along with a thorough analysis of the data itself. The Data itself contains a wide range of information about the tracks covering over a 100 years of music. Some of these informative factors are - acousticness, danceability, energy, intrumentalness, liveness, duration, key, loudness etc.

## Models
The first model planned to be used on the above data is the ARIMA Model as the baseline along with maybe a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Model as these are the one of the commonly used Models for Time Series Prediction.
